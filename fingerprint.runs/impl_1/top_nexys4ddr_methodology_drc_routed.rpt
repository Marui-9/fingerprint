2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-15#1 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_0_0 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#2 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_0_1 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#3 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_1_0 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#4 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#5 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_2_0 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#6 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_2_1 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#7 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_3_0 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#8 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM tmpl_bram/ram_reg_3_1 because address width (13) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired..
